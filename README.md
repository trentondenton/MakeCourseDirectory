## Make A Course Directory 😎
<p>
A simple NodeJS script that I created to fix the mundane task of creating a new folder
system for each 8 week course I take.

### _How-To_ 🤔:
+ Rename myPath.example.js to myPath.js
+ Add the path to your courses directory in myPath.js
+ Pass your course name into the function in makeCourseDir.js
+ In your terminal run node makeCourseDir.js

### _Output_:
+ 📁 My Course
  + 📂 Final
  + 📂 Week 1
  + 📂 Week 2
  + 📂 Week 3
  + 📂 Week 4
  + 📂 Week 5
  + 📂 Week 6
  + 📂 Week 7
  + 📂 Week 8
